# What is this app
This is an app for an organization at my school called DECA. DECA is an entrepreneurship organization that emphasizes networking, business building and community service. This app is created to automate entering participation records of over 255 club members.

# How do we do it?
We created a way of using QR codes to identify members, which when scanned with the scanner in app would then can call to Cloud Firestore to update the point data for a member. Furthermore, we have also implemented a search bar to quickly find and add users who may not have their phone to show their QR Code.

# What does it solve?
The app automates a lot of the manual labor that goes into writing down member names and entering the member names in a excel spreadsheet to keep track of points. Moreover, this app is also a quick way for a member to view their gold points, the events they have attended as well as the groups they are in.
