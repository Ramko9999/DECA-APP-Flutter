# DECA APP

# What is this app
This is an app for an organization at my school called DECA. DECA is an entrepreneurship organization that emphasizes networking, business building and community service. This app is created to automate some of the manual mundane tasks that the leaders in DECA have to perform to keep track of member data.

# How do we do it?

We created a way of using QR codes to identify members, which then can call to a database like Cloud Firestore to store the data.
