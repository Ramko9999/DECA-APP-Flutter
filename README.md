# DECA APP

# What is this app
This is an app for an organization at my school called DECA. DECA is an entrepreneurship organization that emphasizes networking, business building and community service. This app is created to automate entering participation records and streamline communication with over 255 club members; implemented a QR-code check-in system that saves 100+ hours in manually copying member records from paper to a spreadsheet and simplified process for members to check their club information.

# How do we do it?
We created a way of using QR codes to identify members, which then can call to a database like Cloud Firestore to store the data.
